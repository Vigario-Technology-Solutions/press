// Starter skeleton for a VTS printable. COPY this — do not import it.
// Composition belongs to the document; only the vocabulary is shared.
//
//   typst init --package-path vendor/press/packages @vts/press:0.1.0 <name>
//
// (that path is from a repo consuming press as a submodule at vendor/press;
//  from inside the press repo itself it is just --package-path packages)
//
// or just copy this file to docs/<name>.typ and start deleting.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The conventions this skeleton encodes. They are what make a document
// scannable; the tokens alone will not do it.
//
//   1. MEAT FIRST. Whatever the reader must act on goes at the top. Attention
//      is spent before it is earned back — do not make them read design detail
//      to reach a decision.
//   2. ONE IDEA PER UNIT, opened by a bold LEAD. That lead is the highlight,
//      pre-made, so nobody has to reach for a marker.
//   3. UNITS ARE SELF-CONTAINED. Nothing may assume the unit above it was
//      read. Sections get read out of order and returned to weeks later.
//   4. BANDS CARRY A ROLE — decide / design / reference. Skipping a section
//      should be a deliberate choice, not something discovered afterwards.
//   5. COLOUR IS STATE, never decoration, and it gets a legend.
//   6. NO LENGTH CAP. If a unit needs depth, give it depth, or push the depth
//      to a second layer — but never delete it to fit a layout. If it does not
//      fit, the layout is what changes.
