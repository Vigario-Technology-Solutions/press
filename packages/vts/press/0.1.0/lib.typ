// vts/press — the house apparatus for VTS printables.
//
//   #import "@vts/press:0.1.0": *
//
// 0.1.0 is the first and only published version; this directory has never held
// another. It carries the composition vocabulary — `unit`, `chip`,
// `band-strong`, `dbadge`, `decision` — which had been copy-pasted between
// documents while the pipeline was still a prototype inside server-admin. None
// of them was ever document-specific; they lived in the documents only because
// that is where they were first written, and `unit` and `chip` had already gone
// byte-identical across three files. That is the same drift this pipeline
// exists to prevent, one level down.
//
// Published versions are immutable. A change goes in a NEW directory with a
// bumped `typst.toml` — consumers pin an exact version, and a silent edit
// underneath them is the failure packaging exists to prevent.
//
// What deliberately did NOT move: composition. Section order, page choice,
// which diagrams exist, how deep a document layers — that stays local. The
// library supplies vocabulary, the document writes the sentence.
//
// This library is ADDITIVE, not governing. Nothing here takes effect unless a
// document calls it: it sets no page and installs no show rule of its own
// accord, and assumes no layout. The document owns its page and takes whichever
// parts serve it. That inversion is deliberate — a template that owns the page
// is what forces every document with real layout needs to escape the system.
//
// "Not governing" limits what this library ENFORCES, never what it may OFFER. A
// styling helper a document opts into enforces nothing. Treating styling as out
// of scope leaves every document inventing its own, which is the copy-paste
// drift this package exists to end. It is a helper, not a governor: documents
// vary too much for it to be anything else.
//
// Fonts are vendored beside this file rather than named from the system.
// Typst does NOT perform metric substitution the way fontconfig does: on a box
// without Arial, `#set text(font: "Arial")` emits only `warning: unknown font
// family` and silently falls back to an embedded serif. Since 0.15 has no
// deny-warnings flag, that mistake ships. Hence: faces are exported constants
// below, so a typo is an unknown-variable ERROR, and callers pass `face-*`
// rather than a string.
//
// That covers the FAMILY level only, which is the loudest of three. A missing
// WEIGHT and a missing GLYPH each report nothing at all, and
// --ignore-system-fonts does not help because typst's own embedded fonts stay
// reachable. See the face block below, and FONTS.md for the full account. The
// constants are stacks rather than single names for that reason, and
// `just check` is what turns the silent two into something readable.

// Ink & rules
//
// Contrast on white, measured, because these are read on PAPER and a screen
// flatters grey that toner does not. Toner also gains — small type prints
// slightly heavier and lighter in colour than it renders — so screen-legible is
// the floor here, not the target.

//   ink        17.85:1   body
//   ink-soft    8.33:1   secondary
//   ink-faint   6.40:1   tertiary  — started at 3.04, below the 4.5:1 body floor;
//                                    5.51 still read as unpleasant on paper, so it
//                                    was lifted again against a printed sheet
//
// ink-faint was the reported failure: the lightest ink, at the smallest size,
// in italic, doing real work (the seedepth pointers and the footer). Three
// legibility costs stacked on the same run. It is now above the body floor with
// room to spare, and the hierarchy still reads because the gaps between the
// three stayed wide.

// ships stray serif glyphs and nothing says so. Verified: U+2192 (→) is absent
// from Open Sans, and `→` in body text embedded LibertinusSerif-Regular, plus
// LibertinusSerif-Italic wherever the surrounding text was italic.

// arm's length on a sheet. Every step moved up roughly 13%, keeping the ratios.
//
// A document that no longer fits after this should lose content to its depth

// "actual size" needs no scaling — but consumer printers cannot print to the
// paper edge, and that unprintable band is set in hardware with no dialog
// option on most of them. Everything here therefore keeps ink at least 0.5in
// from every edge, which clears the dead band on ordinary lasers and inkjets
// alike. "Fit to page" is then never necessary, and should never be used: it
// scales the sheet down and undoes the type sizes above.
//
// The bottom margin is deliberately larger than the top. The footer sits INSIDE
// the bottom margin, so a symmetric margin puts the footer closer to the edge
// than anything else on the page — measured at 0.23in while the margin claimed
// 0.5in, which is inside the dead band on most hardware. footer-descent is
// pinned here rather than left at its 30%-of-margin default, so the clearance
// is a fixed number instead of a consequence of the margin.

//
// NOTHING PER LINE, deliberately, and for two reasons that are not aesthetic.
//
// It is not a convention anywhere. No style guide frames each command, and a
// reader meeting an invented pattern has to work out what it means first.
//
// It costs the reader their selection. Framing each command in its own box was
// tried on a real sheet and a PDF reader then highlighted the whole group when
// one command was clicked, forcing the reader to drag by hand. These sheets are
// read on screen as well as on paper. The mechanism inside the PDF was not
// established — the obvious candidates were measured and ruled out — but the
// behaviour was observed directly, and it is enough to settle the design.
//
// NO PROMPT AND NO LANGUAGE LABEL. `$`, `PS>` and a `# pwsh` first line all put
// characters on the page that are not part of the command, and every one of them
// has to be edited out after a paste. MDN's guidance is the same. Where a
// document genuinely mixes shells, say so in the prose around the block.
//
// breakable is opt-in. A command split across a page turn is a command with no
// second half, so the default refuses to break; a long listing that legitimately
// spans pages passes `breakable: true` through a closure:
