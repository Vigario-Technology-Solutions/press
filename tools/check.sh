# Paths are relative to the consumer root, which is why the recipe cds there and
# passes press_root separately — the two are the same directory only when press
# is being used on itself.
#
# It lives here rather than inline in press.just because a `just` recipe carrying
# a #!/bin/sh shebang is translated through `cygpath` on Windows, and cygpath is
# absent from PowerShell's PATH even where Git for Windows is installed — so the
# only recipe with a shebang was the only recipe that would not run from pwsh.
# A plain recipe handing a file to sh needs no translation and behaves the same
# from either shell.
#
# The rationale for what each pass does, and the limits of each, is in press.just
# above the recipe. This file is the mechanism; that comment is the argument.

# the character list empty and the pass skips itself while the recipe goes on to report
# the document clean. Probing once, up front, is the difference between an unmet
# dependency and a check that quietly does nothing.
#

# pdftotext and pdffonts are also shipped by Xpdf and mupdf, and they do not agree.
# Measured over one document: Xpdf's default output encoding is Latin-1, which loses
# every non-ASCII character — so every glyph looks missing, and pass two accuses a
# correct document sixteen times over. mupdf's reports a different set again. The
# extractor is not an implementation detail here; it is the instrument the verdict
# is read off, and three instruments give three verdicts on identical input.
#
# This matters most where it is least visible: Git for Windows bundles Xpdf's
# pdftotext in mingw64/bin and Git Bash puts that ahead of a system poppler, so a
# Windows contributor and CI silently run different checks on the same commit.
#
# -v is the discriminator. Poppler prints "The Poppler Developers"; Xpdf prints
# "[www.xpdfreader.com]". Both are checked because a PATH can resolve them to
# different projects.
#
# PRESS_PDFTOTEXT and PRESS_PDFFONTS exist because on Windows PATH is not the
# user's to order. Git for Windows' sh prepends its own /mingw64/bin and
# /usr/bin at startup, so the Xpdf binaries it bundles win inside every recipe
# no matter what PowerShell or a .bashrc resolves — a Windows contributor has
# no reachable lever. Naming the executable directly is that lever, and it is
# press-scoped: nothing else on the machine reads these names, so unlike
# renaming the bundled binaries it shifts no other tool's dependency.
#
# The assertion is unchanged either way. Being pointable does not mean being
# trusted; whatever it is aimed at still has to say poppler.

# Pass three — printable area. A document can overflow the unprintable band

# a box that has poppler but no python at all.
#
# `command -v python3` was the guard and it FAILED BOTH WAYS on Windows.

#   Present but not real: the stock Windows App Execution Alias puts a zero-byte
#   python3 on PATH that prints "Python was not found" and exits 49. command -v
#   said yes, the pass ran, and check exited 1 having printed nothing but a
#   Microsoft Store advert.
#
#   Real but not named python3: disabling that alias — which uv's own setup
#   recommends — leaves a working `python` and no `python3` at all, so the pass
#   silently skipped forever. Measured on a host where it hid a genuine 0.32in
#   clipping fault in a document whose entire purpose was to be printed.
#
# So probe by EXECUTING a candidate rather than by resolving its name, and accept
# `python`, which is what a Windows install is actually called. An interpreter
# that cannot run `pass` is not an interpreter, whatever PATH says about it.
# PRESS_PYTHON is tested SEPARATELY and quoted, never as a word in the candidate
# list. Unquoted it word-splits, and the likeliest Windows value is exactly the
# case that breaks: C:\Program Files\Python312\python.exe becomes "C:\Program" and
# "Files\Python312\python.exe", neither of which runs.
#
# An override that is set but cannot run says so rather than falling through in
# silence -- that is a typo the operator wants to hear about -- but it still falls
# back, because this pass is skippable and a bad override should not take out the

# (*UTF) forces PCRE to match characters rather than bytes. Without it the class
# is byte-oriented under a non-UTF-8 locale, so every multi-byte character is split
# into its bytes and each byte is probed as though it were a character — none of
# which render, so a clean document reports one false missing glyph per byte.
#
# The verb rather than LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 on purpose: the locale must exist to take
# effect, macOS has no C.UTF-8, and glibc falls back to C *silently* when a locale
# is missing. That reintroduces the bug while the check reports success, which is
# the one failure mode this recipe exists to prevent. The verb needs nothing from
# the environment; the guard above is what makes its absence loud.
#
# `|| true` stays: grep exits 1 on a document with no non-ASCII characters at all,
# which is a clean result, not an error. Exit 2 is what would matter here, and the
# guard has already ruled out the only way to provoke it.

# \p{Z} and \p{Cf} are dropped because only a character that HAS a glyph can be

# that is correct. Stray invisible characters in source are a real concern and a
