"""Report lines of text printed on top of other lines, per page.

Exists because a document can collide with itself, pass every other check, and
reach paper. Nothing typst emits is wrong — the document is valid and it simply
renders on top of itself — so there is no warning to read and no font to blame.
It was found in practice by a person looking at a rendered page, more than once,
which is the failure mode `check` exists to remove.

Reads word positions via `pdftotext -bbox-layout`, so it needs poppler — the
same dependency `check` already asserts — plus a Python to run this file.

WHY NOT THE RASTER, given the printable-area check already renders each page
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because a rendered page has thrown the answer away. "Two lines drawn on each
other" and "one line drawn once" are the same pixels; nothing in the image says
what was drawn on top of what. Tested anyway rather than assumed — merged-band
detection over a five-document corpus at six thresholds from 0.001 to 0.05 scored
ZERO on the known defect at every threshold while false-positiving on a clean
document at the low end. There is no setting that separates them.

`pdftotext` works precisely because it reads the text-positioning operators the
raster discards. That is also why the printable-area check stays raster while
this one cannot: "is there ink near the paper edge" needs no layering at all and
must see panels and rules as well as glyphs, whereas layering is the entire
question here.

WHY POPPLER'S LINE GROUPING RATHER THAN OUR OWN
-----------------------------------------------
The first attempt grouped words into lines by rounding their vertical midpoint.
On a known-good four-page document that produced 23 false positives, worst at
7.90pt, every one of them prose paired with an inline `raw` span: mono at a
smaller size has a different vertical centre, so one visual line splits into two
bands and reads as a collision.

Those false positives were LARGER than the real defect they were meant to find
(7.90pt against 2.96pt), so no tolerance could separate them. `-bbox-layout`
emits poppler's own <line> elements, which span mixed-font runs correctly and
take the count to zero.

# A line pair must overlap by more than this to be reported. Not cosmetic, and
# not tuned to taste: rotated text is the one construct that produces phantom
# overlaps, because poppler segments rotated glyphs into fragments and reports
# them as separate lines. Measured worst case was 0.13pt, on a page carrying 90°
# and -45° rotations. The smallest GENUINE collision measured across six defect
# shapes was 2.72pt. The floor sits in the middle of a gap with nothing in it.
