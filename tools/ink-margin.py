"""Report the smallest distance from any ink to any paper edge, per page.

Exists because a document can overflow the printable area silently: typst has
no concept of a printer's unprintable band, so the failure only appears on
paper, after the sheet is in your hand.

Reads PGM pages by rendering via pdftoppm, so it needs poppler — the same
dependency `check` already has — plus a Python to run this file.

`check` finds that interpreter by EXECUTING a candidate rather than by resolving
the name `python3`, and accepts `python`. On Windows the name proves nothing in
either direction: the App Execution Alias puts a zero-byte `python3` on PATH that
answers `command -v` and then exits 49, and disabling that alias leaves a working
`python` with no `python3` at all. Where neither is found, `check` skips this pass
rather than failing, because the font checks are worth having on their own.

PRESS_PYTHON and PRESS_PDFTOPPM name either executable directly, for the same
reason PRESS_PDFTOTEXT exists: on Windows PATH is not the contributor's to order.
