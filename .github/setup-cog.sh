# setup-cog.sh — make a pinned cocogitto usable in the commit-convention jobs.
#
# Setup rather than install, because installing the binary is not sufficient to run
# it: see the git identity below.
#
# A file rather than two copies of the same block inside commit-convention.yml. Both
# jobs need it, and a duplicated install is a duplicated pin: the version and digest
# would sit in two places and drift apart at the first bump, which is the failure the
# digest exists to prevent.
#
# A plain script rather than a composite action, even though rule 5 asks for a
# composite for anything used twice. A composite is right for the typst toolchain
# beside it, which has inputs and conditional steps. This has neither, and a
# directory plus an action.yml to wrap five lines of curl costs a reader one more
# file before they learn what runs.
#
# Invoked as `sh .github/setup-cog.sh`, the same way press.just runs tools/check.sh
# and for the same reason: handing the file to an interpreter depends on nothing
# about the file itself. The mode bit is set and the shebang is here so it can also
# be run directly, but neither is load-bearing — a mode lost through an archive, an
# export or a filesystem that does not carry one leaves the workflow working.
#
# Reads COG_VERSION and COG_SHA256 from the environment. They are set once at the
# workflow level so there is exactly one place to edit on a bump.

# A git identity, because `cog verify` ABORTS without one.
#
# Not findable on a workstation: any machine that has ever committed has a
# user.name, so verify works everywhere except a fresh runner, which has no
# ~/.gitconfig. cog unwraps the lookup:
#
#   thread 'main' panicked at crates/cocogitto/src/bin/cog/main.rs:584
#   called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value:
#     Other(Error { code: -3, klass: 7, message: "config value 'user.name' was not found" })
#
# Exit 134, a core dump, and a failed check whose message says nothing about commit
# conventions. Reproduced with an empty HOME, and fixed by exactly this.
#
# It must be a real config entry. GIT_CONFIG_COUNT / GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n was the tidier
# candidate and it does NOT work — libgit2 does not read those, and the panic is
# unchanged. Measured, not assumed.
#
# `cog check` does not need an identity; only `verify` does. Both jobs get it anyway,
# because Lint main falls back to `verify` when its range is unanswerable, and that
# fallback exists precisely for the disordered cases nobody rehearses.
#
# Nothing here ever commits. cog reads the identity only to print an author beside
# the message it is checking.
